# Python Mini Games

Simple Python games built for learning fundamental Python concepts--input validation, game loops, basic logic, etc. Claude-4-sonnet code review locally, but otherwise built without AI like a brutal masochist.

## Games

- **Hangman** - Word guessing game with letter validation and user output
- **Guess the Number** - Number guessing game with narrowing range
